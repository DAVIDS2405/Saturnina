Welcome to the "Saturnina" project! This project is a backend application designed and developed by **David Basantes** as part of his thesis for the Escuela Polit√©cnica Nacional.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Database**: SurrealDB

FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs with Python, and SurrealDB is used as the database technology for this project. Together, they provide a powerful foundation for creating efficient and robust web applications.

This project aims to provide a powerful backend solution for Saturnina, an online clothing customization store. The mobile and frontend aspects of the project have been developed by **Jose Pinos** and **Miguel Carapaz**.

You can find Saturnina on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/saturnina.uio/?hl=es-la), where they showcase their unique and customizable clothing items.
